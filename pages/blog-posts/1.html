          6 October 2025 is my first day of internship. The day before, I felt
          abit nervous cus I never done an internship before. The instruction
          given to me was to go to the office and sign in at the receptionist.
          After that, I waited about 2 hours until I decided to text my
          supervisor. Only then I know that all of other interns were assigned
          to the client office.

          Arriving there, I can see my teams who are working on the current
          project. I was greeted and get to know all of them which changes my
          perspective of working at this company. I never know working in a team
          could be this a whole lot of fun! In a week I was able to learn a lot
          about the real process that is being done in a financial industry
          project. From development until the final testing process, it was a
          lot to be kept in mind at that time. Thanks to my friends and the
          senior here, I was able to adapt myself and get along with them. To a
          whole lot more adventure with my team! :)
