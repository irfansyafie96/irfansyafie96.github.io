            My name is Irfan Syafie, someone who are interested in learning
            getting to know the latest tech in software development. But before
            getting into this industry, I was a mechanical student in my
            secondary school until when it's time to continue my study in the
            college, I chose computer science just because my cousin chose it. I
            had no guide but to just continue my study and get along with it.

            I love playing video games and sports. The sports that I play are
            mostly football and futsal, but I also have fun playing badminton
            and volleyball. I listen to music a lot, too. Bands like Radiohead
            and Tame Impala have really grown on me this past year, but I listen
            to any songs as long as I think they are good. Movies and series are
            a must for me, especially when I don't have the mood to play games.
